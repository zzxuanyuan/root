Any other solution to specifically add the flag -finline-visibility-hidden to files including DeclTemplate.h is not possible because of other includes shared by other parts of the system. The only solution would be to apply the flag globally to the whole ROOT project.

# Rebase 6475569..b908c22 onto 848b631 (83 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
